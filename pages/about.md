I'm a Informatic Engineering graduated. My main interests are Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence and Physics. I love to play CTFs in my free time. I play for the [xSTF](https://ctftime.org/team/15341){:target="_blank"} team of University of Porto since 2017. I focus on Reserve engineering and Web challenges that is my main area of interest.
