I hold a degree in Informatic Engineering, also have eWPTXV2, eCPPT, and CMPen certifications. Worked in software engineering for four years. I've worked with various technologies, with a primary focus on Android development. In 2022, I moved to the cybersecurity field, fulfilling a childhood dream and passion. My focus lies in mobile security and reverse engineering, and I also have an interest in malware analysis and development.

Currently, I work as a Pentester at [Integrity](https://www.integrity.pt/){:target="_blank"}. From 2017 to 2020 I was a CTF player for the [xSTF](https://ctftime.org/team/15341){:target="_blank"} team at the University of Porto, specializing in Reverse Engineering and Web challenges.
